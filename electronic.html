<h3>A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a type of transistor that uses both electrons and electron holes as charge carriers.<br> In contrast, a unipolar transistor, such as a field-effect transistor, uses only one kind of charge carrier. A bipolar <br>transistor allows a small current injected at one of its terminals to control a much larger current flowing between the<br> terminals, making the device capable of amplification or switching.

BJTs use two pâ€“n junctions between two semiconductor<br> types, n-type and p-type, which are regions in a single crystal of material. The junctions can be made in several different<br> ways, such as changing the doping of the semiconductor material as it is grown, by depositing metal pellets to form alloy <br>junctions, or by such methods as diffusion of n-type and p-type doping substances into the crystal. The superior<br> predictability and performance of junction transistors quickly displaced the original point-contact transistor. Diffused <br>transistors, along with other components, are elements of integrated circuits for analog and digital functions. Hundreds <br>of bipolar junction transistors can be made in one circuit at very low cost.

Bipolar transistor integrated circuits were the <br>main active devices of a generation of mainframe and minicomputers, but most computer systems now use CMOS integrated <br>circuits relying on field-effect transistors. Bipolar transistors are still used for amplification of signals, switching, and in mixed-<br>signal integrated circuits using BiCMOS. Specialized types are used for high voltage switches, for radio-frequency amplifiers,<br> or for switching high currents.

<h2>Current direction conventions</h2>

<h3>By convention, the direction of current on diagrams is shown as the direction that a positive charge would move. This is called <br>conventional current. However, current in metal conductors is generally[a] due to the flow of electrons. Because electrons carry<br> a negative charge, they move in the direction opposite to conventional current. On the other hand, inside a bipolar transistor,<br> currents can be composed of both positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons. In this article, current arrows <br>are shown in the conventional direction, but labels for the movement of holes and electrons show their actual direction inside<br> the transistor.</h3>
<br><br><h2>Function</h2>
<h3>BJTs exist as PNP and NPN types, based on the doping types of the three main terminal regions. An NPN transistor comprises <br>two semiconductor junctions that share a thin p-doped region, and a PNP transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions <br>that share a thin n-doped region. N-type means doped with impurities (such as phosphorus or arsenic) that provide mobile<br> electrons, while p-type means doped with impurities (such as boron) that provide holes that readily accept electrons.Charge <br>flow in a BJT is due to diffusion of charge carriers (electrons and holes) across a junction between two regions of different <br>charge carrier concentration. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, base, and collector.[b] A discrete transistor has three leads <br>for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers, and the collector<br> is doped more lightly (typically ten times lighter[2]) than the base. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow <br>of charge carriers injected from a heavily doped emitter into the base where they are minority carriers (electrons in NPNs, holes<br> in PNPs) that diffuse toward the collector, so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.</h3>
